# HEAL Data Utilities

The HEAL Data Utilities python package provides data packaging tools for the HEAL Data Ecosystem to facilitate data discovery, sharing, and harmonization with a focus on the HEAL Platform Data Consultancy (DSC).
 
Currently, the focus of this repository is generating data dictionaries ([click here](vlmd/index.md) for the Variable-level Metadata documentation section). However, in the future, this will be expanded for all HEAL-specific data packaging functions (e.g., study- and file-level metadata and data).
