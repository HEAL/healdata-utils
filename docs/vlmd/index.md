# Variable-level Metadata (Data Dictionaries)


## Motivation

Variable level metadata (VLMD), in the form of standardized data dictionaries, provides an exciting opportunity:

-  a way to search, understand, and compare datasets before (potentially sensitive) data is shared. 

> For an example of this searchability in the context of study level metadata, [see the platform's discovery page](https://healdata.org/portal/discovery)

- When data is available, VLMD provides a way to validate the data as well.

- Supports HEAL projects and goals such as the [common data elements program](https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements)


## Functions

`extract`: Extract the variable level metadata from an existing file with a specific
  type/format

`start`: Start a data dictionary from an empty template

`validate`: Check (validate) an existing HEAL data dictionary file to see if it follows the HEAL specifications after filling out a template or further annotation after extracting from a different format.

!!! note ""

    Typical workflows for creating a HEAL-compliant data dictionary include:

    1. **Create your data dictionary**

        (a) Run the `vlmd extract` command (or `convert_to_vlmd` if in python) to generate a HEAL-compliant data dictionary via your desired input format 

        (b) Run the `vlmd template` command to start from an empty template.

    2. **Add/annotate with** additional information in your preferred HEAL data dictionary format (either `json` or `csv`).
        - To further annotate and use the data dictionary, see the variable-level metadata field property information below:
            - [`csv` data dictionary](./schemas/csv-fields.md)
            - [`json` data dictionary](./schemas/json-data-dictionary.md)

    3. **Run the `vlmd validate` command**  with your HEAL data dictioanry as the input to validate.

    4. Repeat (2) and (3) until you are ready to submit. Please note, currently only `name` and `description` are required.


## Definitions

!!! important

    The main difference* between the CSV and JSON definitions lies in the way the data dictionaries are structured and the additional metadata included in the JSON data dictionary.
    
    The CSV data dictionary is a plain tabular representation with no additional metadata, while the JSON dataset includes fields along with additional metadata in the form of a root description and title.

    * for field-specific differences, see the schemas in the documentation. 

For more information on variable-level metadata properties (fields), see the [`csv` field specification](./schemas/csv-fields.md) and [`json` data dictionary specification](./schemas/json-data-dictionary.md).
